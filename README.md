The lion of the north, having watched this evil for many years, resolves himself to take a stand. He and his pride are the only ones who can stop the witch's evil, and must therefore commit themselves to stopping her evil conquest.
On one fateful Fall night, their swords clash. Though the witch is strong, through the power of all the beasts in the west, the Lion is able to stop her conquest, causing her to fall into a deep slumber.
But her evil minions still walk the earth, causing havoc in hopes of her return, all the while the warlock of the west who once held the favor of all the western beasts, has revealed his true nature in absence of the witch, as the lions ultimate enemy.
