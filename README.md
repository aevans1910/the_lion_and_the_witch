An evil witch has all but taken over the world, murdering all who stand in her path.
The lion of the north has watched this evil for many years. He and his pride are the only ones who can stop the witches evil, and commit themselves to stopping her evil conquest.
On one fateful Fall night, through the power of all the beasts in the west, the Lion is able to stop her conquest, causing her to fall into a deep slumber.
But her evil minions still walk the earth, casuing havok in hopes of her return, all the while the warlock of the west who once held the favor of all the western beasts, has revealed his true nature, as the lions ultimate enemy.
